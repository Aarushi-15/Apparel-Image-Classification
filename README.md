# Apparel-Image-Classification
**Project Title**: Apparel Image Classification

**Objective**: The project aimed to identify different pieces of apparel spread over 10 classes.

**Methods**: A Convolution Neural Network Architecture was utilized to achieve our objectives.

**Key Findings**: The project resulted in a accuracy of 91.02% for generating the correct label according to the label.

In summary, we have successfully applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to perform image classification on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
This project showcases the power and versatility of CNNs in image classification tasks. It demonstrates their potential to revolutionize the way we categorize and analyze visual data, with applications extending far beyond fashion recognition. As technology continues to advance, CNNs remain a pivotal tool for solving complex image-based challenges in the modern era.
